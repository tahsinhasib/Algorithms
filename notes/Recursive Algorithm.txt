A recursive algorithm is an algorithm that calls itself in order to solve a problem. Recursive algorithms 
are used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. The key idea behind 
recursion is to divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve those subproblems recursively, and then 
combine the solutions to the subproblems to find the solution to the original problem.

In a recursive algorithm, a function calls itself with a modified version of the original input, until the 
input is small enough that it can be solved directly. These subproblems are called recursive cases, and the 
function defines a base case or stopping condition to stop the recursion.

The base case is a simple and well-defined problem, which can be solved without recursion. Once the base 
case is reached, the function will start returning the solutions of the subproblems back up the recursive 
call stack, and use them to find the solution to the original problem.

Recursive algorithms can be more elegant and easier to understand than iterative algorithms, but they have 
a higher time complexity and a higher risk of stack overflow.

Recursive algorithms are mostly used in problems related to mathematics, tree and graph traversals, and 
recursive data structures like linked lists and trees.

Examples of problems that can be solved using recursive algorithms include factorial calculation, Fibonacci 
sequence, towers of Hanoi, and traversing a directory structure.
